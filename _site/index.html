					<p>My specialization is <em>inclusive web development</em>. If it can be done on the web, I believe that it can be done responsively, it can be done accessibly, and it can be done in a performant way—it can be made to work for everyone.</p>

		<p>I’m a developer that heavily skews “designer.” From design to implementation, I believe that a good layout is a flexible, durable, and maintainable one.</p>
<p>I’ve helped clients like <a href="https://rollingstone.com">Rolling Stone</a> with their performance concerns, clients like <a href="https://axios.com">Axios</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mwf">Microsoft</a> with their accessibility concerns, and Amazon’s <a href="https://www.pillpack.com/">Pillpack</a> with—well, building their website.</p>
<h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
<p>I’m incredibly fortunate to have played a small part in the history of Responsive Web Design, from eavesdropping on the earliest discussions of the responsive <a href="https://bostonglobe.com">Boston Globe</a> project—all the way back in 2011—to leading the addition of responsive image features to the HTML5 specification, native browser implementations, and major CMSes.</p>
<h3>Front-End Performance</h3>
<p>I’ve had the privilege of traveling the world speaking about front-end performance, at conferences like An Event Apart and Smashing. I’ve worked with organizations large and small not just to audit, identify, and help fix their performance pain points, but to establish workflows, development habits, and support systems that allow those improvements—and their results—to persist long after I’m gone.</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>I firmly believe that accessibility isn’t an add-on, a line item, or an ticket languishing in an issue tracker for “if we have time at the end.” It’s a persistent consideration through every step in the creation of a site—from content, to wireframes, to markup, to the final product. In the years that followed my accessibility work on the <a href="https://jquery.org/team/">jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile teams</a>, I’ve helped guide a number of organizations through the process of prioritizing accessibility both technically <em>and</em> culturally.</p>

		<p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/javascript-for-web-designers">JavaScript for Web Designers</a>. It’s paced for anyone taking their first steps into the world of JavaScript development.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/image-performance">Image Performance</a> just last year. It’s a deep-dive into a subject that’s easy to take for granted, but difficult to master: “putting images on the web.” It covers everything from the ins and outs of image formats and compression methods to responsive image markup to automation</p>
<p>Before writing two books of my own, I wrote the <em>Robust, Responsible, Responsive Web Design</em> chapter of <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-4-new-perspectives/">Smashing Book 4</a>, and two chapters on JavaScript for <a href="https://www.learningwebdesign.com/">Learning Web Design</a>.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed, maybe someday I’ll add <a href="https://wiltomakesfood.com">a cookbook</a> to the list.</p>

I’m an amateur boxer, <a href="https://wiltomakesfood">aspiring chef</a>, halfway decent carpenter, passable antique British motorcycle mechanic, and wannabe gardener.</p>
<p>I’ve even been in a movie—<a href="http://www.futureisnext.com/">What Comes Next is the Future</a>—to discuss the role I played in web standards, and how I hoped to change them. I’ve got an <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8414808/">IMDB page</a> and everything!</p>
<p>Just—… just ignore the other thing on there.</p>
<p>It’s a long story.</p>
