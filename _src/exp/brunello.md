I began my time at Brunello Creative as an intern, brought in to assist when their new web design and development offerings. I learned quickly, and was offered a paid full-time position after just a few weeks. Later—as dedicated web-focused staff grew—I was promoted to lead developer.

Responsibilities included:

* A trial-by-fire approach to learning web design and front-end development, at a time when the field itself was—in a very relative sense—brand new.
* Directly responsibility for day-to-day work on Brunello’s most difficult and/or highest profile design and development projects.
* As both demand for web services and staff increased, providing day-to-day guidance and leadership to newer team members
